# cs4353-parking

### Introduction
Your goal is to model a parking lot using object-oriented programming principles. This project is relatively
open-ended; we will be grading based on your use of OOP principles.
Assumptions:
  1. A parking lot has a capacity.
  2. A parking lot has entrance and exit gates.
  3. Cars receive a time-stamped ticket at entry.
  4. Cars present the ticket at exit gates, pay and then leave the parking lot.
  5. Cars cannot be admitted if there is no space in the parking lot.
  > Goal: The owners of parking lots want you to maximize their profits.
### Instructions
Create a project named parking on your GitHub account. Please use git tag and tag your submission
version as final. If you wanted to make extra revisions after that it’s fine (as long as it is before deadline),
as long as you tag them v.1.XX where XX represents a number. We will grade the v.1 with the highest
value. Note that “.” must be there for versioning the v.1 tags.
Have your project read from a text file in whatever format you consider appropriate and submit five
text files with various inputs for testing along with your code. Be sure to consider input validation!
